# Intro

I've been programming since the late 70's; since 1983 as a pro until I became ill in 2003.

Since then I have not worked at all and have suffered more ill health. However, I have kept in touch (just) and have recently become interested in training myself up again. I have plenty of already paid for and free courses lined up to plough through including C++ (more of a refresher and update from 20 years ago!), html5, css, javascript, node, java, and related stuff.

My training will be a fluid progression as I learn what I probably need to know about before something else. There is plenty to go at but the most important I can figure out so far is javascript and node.js. Things may change. I have begun with C++ as I used to use it a bit and I know java is similar and as far as I know if I know C++ to a reasonable stanadard I won't have much trouble with anything else. It will at least get my brain juices flowing.

Progress will be slow simply because of the time I can spend on things. I get tired quickly and need a lot of sleep. I want to get to know Git too, hence all this, and I want to store and show my training project work here, not least so I can refer to it like normal course work.

I hope to be able to work from home doing something - I will know what it is at the appropriate time. Until then it passes the time.
